My personal blog and website showcase for my portfolio

## What's this
This is a backup of my blog at davodana.com. It is a WordPress website and backed up using the GitHubSync plugin. My plan is to write the theme used on this blog from scratch. That is proceeding very slowly.

I also link to a version of my blog written in ReactJS that was written entirely by myself, and a protfolio of projects, mostly from my Awesome Inc boot camp training.
